* Variables will be named according to their feature names

# Step 2:
* Combining the different data sources to a unique data set
* Selection of variables with the "mean" or "std" in their name for further
* Merge the data to the tidy_data set

# Step 3:
* Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Uses the factor function in R 

# Step 4:
* Appropiately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
* Uses regular expressions and the tolower function to clean variable names

# Step 5:
* Creates a new data frame from the tidy data
* Groups the data set by subject and activity
* Computes the mean of average for each activity and each subject
* Writes the results to Tidy_data.txt
